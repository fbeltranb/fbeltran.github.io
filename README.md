# I am an Economist at the Financial Policy Division of the Central Bank of Chile. Prior to joining the Central Bank of Chile, I worked at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Ministry of Economy of Chile and the Department of Economics at the University of Chile. My research field is macroeconomics, with interests in applied Macroeconomics and International Economics.
I obtained my Ph.D at the Economics Department of the University of Chile

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
